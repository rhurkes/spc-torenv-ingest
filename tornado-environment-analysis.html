      <h1>A Brief Analysis of SPC's Tornado Environment Data</h1>
      <p>It's fairly well known that tornadoes occur throughout much of the central United States, and the term "Tornado Alley" has established itself as a colloquialism. From a meteorological perspective, there isn't a rigid definition for the bounds of Tornado Alley, and there are arguments for the existence of multiple tornado alleys such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Alley">Dixie Alley</a> in the southeast US. Regardless of the above, professional and amateur meteorologists agree that the central US from Mexico to Canada has a high number of tornadic events in relatively similar environments:</p>

      <p>"Relatively similar" has helped create some general rules for parameters favorable for tornadoes (when I use the word "rules" throughout the rest of this post, assume I mean the quoted version that is a stand-in for "rough guideline, and rules are made to be broken"). While it's good enough for a media narrative explaining severe weather to the general public, anyone that has witnessed tornadoes in both Colorado on the western edge of Tornado Alley, and Missouri on the eastern edge, has noticed that the storms and their environments, can differ quite a bit. To compensate for these differences, the weather community has amended some of these rules with further rules:</p>
