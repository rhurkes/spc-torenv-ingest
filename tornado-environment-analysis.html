      <h1>A Brief Analysis of SPC's Tornado Environment Data</h1>
      <p>It's fairly well known that tornadoes occur throughout much of the central United States, and the term "Tornado Alley" has established itself as a colloquialism. From a meteorological perspective, there isn't a rigid definition for the bounds of Tornado Alley, and there are arguments for the existence of multiple tornado alleys such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dixie_Alley">Dixie Alley</a> in the southeast US. Regardless of the above, professional and amateur meteorologists agree that the central US from Mexico to Canada has a high number of tornadic events in relatively similar environments:</p>

        <span class="credit">source: NOAA</span>
      </div>
      <p>"Relatively similar" has helped create some general rules for parameters favorable for tornadoes (when I use the word "rules" throughout the rest of this post, assume I mean the quoted version that is a stand-in for "rough guideline, and rules are made to be broken"). While it's good enough for a media narrative explaining severe weather to the general public, anyone that has witnessed tornadoes in both Colorado on the western edge of Tornado Alley, and Missouri on the eastern edge, has noticed that the storms and their environments, can differ quite a bit. To compensate for these differences, the weather community has amended some of these rules with further rules:</p>
      <div class="mui-panel">
        <ul>
          <li>Surface dewpoints can be lower than 60°F in upslope conditions</li>
          <li>Lifted Condensation Level (LCL) can be higher in upslope conditions</li>
          <li>Instability can be lower in upslope conditions</li>
          <li>Higher shear can compensate for lower instability in Dixie Alley</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>For many years, these guidelines were passed around the weather community with primarily anecdotal evidence supporting them, ie. "I saw a tornado outside of Denver and the dews were only 53°". While not completely inaccurate, these guidelines were definitely imprecise. If you need 60° dews in Salina, and 50° dews in Denver - do you need 55° dews in Hays, KS halfway between the two cities? Where does "upslope" start?</p>
      <h2>Ingesting SPC's Tornado Environment Browser Data</h2>
      <p>Thankfully, John Hart at the Storm Prediction Center compiled a large amount of storm environment data all across the US, and made a <a href="http://www.spc.noaa.gov/exper/envbrowser/">tornado environment browser</a>. With grid points spaced roughly every 1 degree, this data is granular enough to allow for some analysis to be done, and has some of the more useful forecasting parameters baked in:</p>

        <img src="images/envbw.gif" alt="Tornado Environment Parameters" class="post-inline" />
        <span class="credit">source: Storm Prediction Center</span>
      </div>
      <p>While the SPC makes some commonly-used data available, there isn't a huge demand for the tornado environment data, so if I want to use this data, I need to fall back to parsing it the hard way. Eventually, I'll put the source code for this up on my <a href="https://github.com/rhurkes/">GitHub</a>, but for brevity, the basic process is:</p>
      <div class="mui-panel">
        <ol>
          <li>Retrieve all grid point images</li>
          <li>Grab lat/lon values and create a map for grid X/Y values</li>
          <li>OCR the event count (optional)</li>
          <li>Inspect the pixel values to interpolate box/whisker data points</li>
          <li>Query the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov/epqs/">USGS web service</a> with lat/lon to get elevation data</li>
          <li>Throw all this data into a database (PostgreSQL will do nicely)</li>
          <li>Create a simple API to expose these values in bulk</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div class="mui-panel">
        <p>A quick side note, yes interpolation is not optimal and I would prefer to have the raw data. In this case, it's not too detrimental though. The MLCAPE values for example, are on a scale of 500 J/Kg across either 31 or 32 pixels, so the margin of error ends up being ~16 J/Kg - small enough to be statistically insignificant for my purposes.</p>
      </div>
      <p>For the grunt work listed above, I ended up using Python which made it fairly trivial. While I work on getting all the data stored and exposing it in a useful manner, I wanted to test with a single grid row and see what patterns emerged. I picked grid row #58 stretching from the Colorado Front Range to the Mississippi River for a few reasons:</p>
      <div class="mui-panel">
        <ul>
          <li>latitude is somewhat central to Tornado Alley</li>
          <li>the row is adjacent to I-80 to hopefully minimize population bias issues</li>
          <li>no major geographic features interrupting the row like the Buffalo Ridge, Badlands, etc.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>For visualizing this data, I've been playing with a few different charting libraries and this time decided to experiment with Google's <a href="https://developers.google.com/chart/">charting library</a>. It's a good blend of functionality and ease of use, has some nice features like trend lines and dual-Y charts, but you aren't bogged down in verbose configuration like you are with the more full-fledged libraries such as D3.js. Moving on, what does the data look like?</p>
      <h2>LCL Comparison</h2>
      <div class="mui-panel">
        <div id="lcl_chart" class="chart"></div>
      </div>
      <p>Elevation and Lifted Condensation Level (LCL) are fairly linear, which makes comparisons easy. This isn't good enough for modeling convective systems on supercomputers, but it's great to answer the general question of "How does elevation affect LCL height?" Google's "Material" charts are currently the only ones that support dual-Y axis charts, but Material charts are beta and don't support trendlines yet (also just found out that Material charts don't support multiple instantiations, hence the iframe for later charts). We'll have to do some quick math on a piece of paper:</p>
      <div class="mui-panel">
        <div>Elevation linear regression: y = 102.292 * x- 9366.869</div>
        <div>r^2 = 0.923</div>
        <br />
        <div>LCL linear regression: y = 62.905 * x -4981.19</div>
        <div>r^2 = 0.964</div>
        <br />
        <p>It's 78 kilometers between grid points/data points, so at a base median LCL height of ~900 m, and a base elevation of ~200m, for every 78 km traveled west our elevation increases by ~102 m, and median LCL height increases by ~62 m. Let's standardize on 100km and bump everything by ~28% (which is possible since these are linear relationships).</p>
        <strong><p>Every 100 km west from the Mississippi River:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Elevation increases by ~130 m</li>
            <li>Median LCL height increases by ~80 m, or 4/5 of the distance</li>
          </ul></strong>
        </div>
        <h2>MLCAPE Comparison</h2>
        <p>There unfortunately isn't surface dewpoint data available in this data set to solve the earlier dilemma about the dewpoint in Hays, KS - but there is Median Mixed-Layer Convective Available Potential Energy, aka MLCAPE, aka "instability". Let's switch from line to scatter charts here because Material Charts are still in beta and don't support data points on line charts (notice a trend here - maybe Material Charts aren't worth using yet?) and the line interpolation causes zone boundaries to be inaccurate:</p>
        <div class="mui-panel">
          <iframe class="chart" src="cape_chart.html"></iframe>
        </div>
        <p>There is no longer a nice, neat linear relationship. There are potentially have a few stories here, so the data is broken out into color-tinted zones.</p>
        <p><strong>Zone 1</strong> is the left-most, green-tinted area stretching roughly from the Mississippi River to central Missouri. Tornadic storms usually require a balanced blend of shear and instability, and I was a little surprised to see a median MLCAPE values of 1452 J/Kg, a value rather close to that of the grid point in far western Kansas (1351 J/Kg). I'm assuming this is a gradual transition to the "high shear/low instability" blend that seems to be common east of the Mississippi.</p>
        <p><strong>Zone 2</strong> is the blue-tinted area between central MO and central KS. It has a median MLCAPE value just shy of 2000 J/Kg, and we're not seeing any lower instability requirements as we increase elevation yet.</p>
        <p><strong>Zone 3</strong> is extremely odd upon inspection. Zone 1 and Zone 2 were essentially as expected, however I thought Zone 2 would gradually transition into the upslope regime. Instead, median MLCAPE values jump from ~2000 J/Kg to ~2500 J/Kg for a short (167 km) distance. If this isn't a data anomaly, my only thought would be that perhaps the slope increase around -100° longitude is pooling moisture.</p>
        <p><strong>Zone 4</strong> is what I expected to see - starting around -100° (the line straight up off the eastern edge of the Texas Panhandle), median MLCAPE is inversely proportionate to elevation starting with a steep drop off of 1900 J/Kg down to just shy of 900 J/Kg. This eyeballs out to about ~200 J/Kg per 1° or 85 km.</p>
        <p>Below is a color-coded map of these four zones and the areas we're talking about:

          <div id="map"></div>
        </div>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>So far, digging through the Tornado Environment Data hasn't led to any revolutionary new theories, but I didn't expect it to. I'm happy that I can finally use more than anecdotal evidence to tack on some new rules:</p>
        <div class="mui-panel">
          <ul>
            <li>There is a gradual elevation increase from the Mississippi River all the way to the front range that is close to 130 m / 100 km</li>
            <li>Along with the gradual elevation increase, there is a gradual lessening dependence on low LCLs as you move west - in the neighborhood of 80 m / 100 km</li>
            <li>Once in upslope regime, tornadic storms require 200 J/Kg less MLCAPE every 85 km</li>
            <li>Upslope regime kicks in around -100° longitude</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>There will likely be an update to this post eventually, as I still need to finish ingesting this data to investigate whether any of this data was anomalous and what's going on with Zone 3, how the Mississippi River transition looks, dig around looking for other relationships, and eventually use this data real-time to help pick which cell will most likely be tornadic when confronted with multiple choices.</p>
